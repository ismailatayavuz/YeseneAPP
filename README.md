# Yesene APP

This food delivery application was meticulously developed with the aim of simulating real-world scenarios, utilizing fictitious data. It's essential to note that the application is not publicly available, lacks any formal agreements with restaurants, and is intended solely for educational and developmental purposes, therefore authentication and payment methods are not used.

Key technologies incorporated into this application consist of React Native, JavaScript, React Navigation, Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind), Sanity for backend, Redux, and Expo for the CLI.
