# YESENE APP

This food delivery application was meticulously developed with the aim of simulating real-world scenarios, utilizing fictitious data. It's essential to note that the application is not publicly available, lacks any formal agreements with restaurants, and is intended solely for educational and developmental purposes, therefore authentication and payment methods are not used.

Key technologies incorporated into this application consist of React Native, JavaScript, React Navigation, Tailwind CSS (via NativeWind), Sanity for backend, Redux, and Expo for the CLI.

The app consists of 6 screens, let us go step by step.

## Home Screen

The Home Screen is the initial screen that appears upon opening the app.

There are categories at the top that can be swiped to the right. When tapped, each category will display its Category Screen.

Additionally, there are featured rows on the body of this Home Screen, which can also be swiped to the right to view the restaurant cards belonging to each featured row. By tapping on each restaurant card, its respective Restaurant Screen will appear. Also by swiping downwards, there are several more featured rows.

This is the Category Screen, which can be swiped downwards to see all the restaurant cards that belong to that specific category. When tapped on, each restaurant card will display its respective Restaurant Screen.

When increasing the items, a button will appear at the bottom, which has the meaning of "go to the basket", and tapping it will display the Basket Screen.

## Basket Screen

Here is the Basket Screen, where you can view all the information related to your delivery. By pressing the button at the botttom, which has the meaning of "place an order", the Preparing Order Screen will appear.

## Preparing Order Screen

The Preparing Order Screen animates until the restaurant accepts your order. Since this is just a demo app and there are no restaurants that accept the order, I have manually configured this screen to stay on for just a couple of seconds before the Delivery Screen appears.

And at last here is the Delivery Screen. Hope you enjoyed viewing the application!
